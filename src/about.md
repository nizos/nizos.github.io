---

I'm a software architect and consultant at [factor10](https://www.factor10.com), focused on building
quality, maintainable solutions with teams who care about their craft.

I'm passionate about Test-Driven Development, agentic coding, and automation, particularly where AI
innovation meets practical software engineering.

My work:

- Built
  [several of Sweden's top-ranked websites](/striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/)
  in performance, security, and accessibility
- Created [TDD Guard](https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard), an open-source tool for agentic coding
  (1.8k GitHub stars, 100k installs)
- Given talks on agentic coding, including
  ["5 Pro Tips for Coding with Agents"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWspNDD7nnQ)

When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching Formula 1, catching up on movies, or binge-watching TV
series.
